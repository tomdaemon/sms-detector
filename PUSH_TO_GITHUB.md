# ðŸš€ Push to GitHub Instructions

Your standalone SMS Detector project is ready! Follow these steps:

## 1. Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `sms-detector` (or any name you prefer)
3. Make it **Public** (for free GitHub Actions)
4. DON'T initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push Your Code

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
cd /Users/tomdaemon/Desktop/SMS/sms-detector-standalone

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/tomdaemon/sms-detector.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `tomdaemon` with your GitHub username in the URL above.

## 3. Watch the Magic! âœ¨

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Actions" tab
3. You'll see the build starting automatically
4. Wait ~5-10 minutes for the build to complete
5. Go to "Releases" section
6. Download your APK!

## What Happens:
- GitHub Actions will automatically:
  - Set up Java and Android SDK
  - Build your APK
  - Create a release
  - Upload the APK

## Troubleshooting:
- If the push fails, you might need to set up git credentials:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  ```

## Current Status:
âœ… Project initialized with git
âœ… All files committed
âœ… GitHub Actions workflow included
âœ… JavaScript bundle included
âœ… Ready to push!

Just create the GitHub repo and push!
